# Generative-Art
This is the generative art piece for my COMSBC3930- Creative Embedded Systems class! To read more about the design rationale behind my project please visit my blog. My blog website is live at https://habitual-cut-97f.notion.site/COMS-BC3930-Generative-Art-10edec921a7f80058105e1a525b1fb82?pvs=74.

My design goals included creating an evening backdrop of twinkling stars with a full moon to capture the festive mood. I wanted to show the special occasion by drawing two rabbits next to each other staring at the moon. Furthermore, I wanted to show the season with red and orange specks on the green grass to represent the dead leaves that fell.

I coded my project on Arduino IDE. For this project, all that is needed is the LILY-TTGO and a USB-C cable that can connect the LILY-TTGO to a power source and a computer for deployment.
